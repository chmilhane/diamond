# Diamond

**Note:** This library was never fully completed, but feel free to reuse or adapt parts of it for your own projects. I originally wrote this when I was just 13, so please be kind when reviewing the code.
It's written in Laux, a sort of enhanced Lua variant originally developed by my friend Patrick Ratzow (who has since abandoned the project). I added a few features of my own on top of it.
The library includes tools to build clean UIs and make database requests more easily and some other stuff that I don't remember about.
